 * retrieval crosses a network that may simply be slow. Each of those is
 * recoverable, but only if the person is told three things — what is wrong,
 * what it means for the text they just typed, and what to do about it.
 *
 * This is a pure function over inputs the host already has, so the
 * messaging lives in one place instead of being re-derived at every call
 * site, and can be unit-tested without a node.
